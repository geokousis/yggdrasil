* TODO Extend branches so that all leaf-labels are on the same level when branch lengths are off.

* TODO When in an internal node or branch, highlight all children and branches.

* TODO Make shortcut behaviour consistent when in tree-buffer and in original buffer.
- Maybe change shortcuts from one-letter ones to C-? or M-?.

* TODO Remove child-frame generation. Keep only window view.

* TODO Extract subtree from point/internal-node.
2 or 3 functions: a) one requires the number of internal node and
extracts newick tree in the kill-ring.
b) in the source buffer: extract subtree at point if point if
located in internal node and store in kill-ring.
c) in the tree buffer, extract all children of node or branch under
the cursor and store newick representation in the kill-ring.
